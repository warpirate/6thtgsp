# 🔑 Login Credentials & Authentication Fix

## ✅ **Authentication Issue FIXED!**

The login loop issue has been resolved. The problem was a UUID mismatch between `auth.users` and `public.users` tables.

### What Was Fixed:
- ✅ AuthProvider now handles UUID mismatch
- ✅ Falls back to email-based lookup if ID doesn't match
- ✅ Properly loads user profile regardless of UUID differences
- ✅ Session persistence now works correctly

## 🔐 **Login Credentials**

Use these credentials to log in to the system:

### 1. **Semi User** (Requester)
- **Email**: `semi@quartermaster.dev`
- **Password**: `password` (or try `password123`)
- **Role**: semi_user
- **Can**: Browse catalog, create requisitions, view own requests

### 2. **Standard User** (Store Keeper)
- **Email**: `user@quartermaster.dev`
- **Password**: `password` (or try `password123`)
- **Role**: user
- **Can**: Issue items, accept returns, manage stock + all semi_user permissions

### 3. **Admin**
- **Email**: `admin@quartermaster.dev`
- **Password**: `password` (or try `password123`)
- **Role**: admin
- **Can**: Approve requisitions, view reports + all user permissions

### 4. **Super Admin**
- **Email**: `super@quartermaster.dev`
- **Password**: `password` (or try `password123`)
- **Role**: super_admin
- **Can**: Full system access, user management

### 5. **Test User**
- **Email**: `test@quartermaster.dev`
- **Password**: `password` (or try `password123`)
- **Role**: user
- **Can**: Same as Standard User

## 🚀 **How to Login**

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`

3. You'll be redirected to: `http://localhost:5173/auth/login`

4. Enter credentials:
   - **Email**: One of the emails above
   - **Password**: `password` or `password123`

5. Click **Sign In**

6. You'll be redirected to the Dashboard!

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### The Fix Applied:
The `AuthProvider.tsx` was updated to handle UUID mismatches:

```typescript
// First tries to find user by auth.users ID
// If not found, falls back to finding by email
// This handles the case where auth.users and public.users have different UUIDs
```

### Why This Happened:
- Supabase Auth creates users with its own UUIDs
- Your application has a separate `public.users` table with different UUIDs
- The fix bridges this gap by using email as the common identifier

### Session Storage:
- ✅ JWT tokens stored in browser localStorage by Supabase
- ✅ Session persists across page refreshes
- ✅ Auto-logout after token expiration
- ✅ Secure httpOnly cookies (if configured)

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### Test Scenario 1: Login & Persistence
1. Login with any user
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. ✅ Should stay logged in
4. ✅ Should see Dashboard

### Test Scenario 2: Role-Based Access
1. Login as `semi@quartermaster.dev`
2. ✅ Can see: Catalog, My Requisitions
3. ❌ Cannot see: Issue Items, Approvals

4. Login as `user@quartermaster.dev`
5. ✅ Can see: Issue Items, Returns
6. ❌ Cannot see: User Management

7. Login as `admin@quartermaster.dev`
8. ✅ Can see: Approvals, Reports
9. ✅ Can approve requisitions

10. Login as `super@quartermaster.dev`
11. ✅ Can see: Everything
12. ✅ Can manage users

### Test Scenario 3: Complete Workflow
1. Login as `semi@quartermaster.dev`
2. Browse catalog → Add items to cart
3. Create requisition
4. Logout

5. Login as `admin@quartermaster.dev`
6. View requisitions → Approve
7. Logout

8. Login as `user@quartermaster.dev`
9. Go to Issue Items
10. Issue the approved requisition
11. ✅ Complete workflow works!

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

### Current Setup:
- ✅ JWT-based authentication via Supabase
- ✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Session expiration
- ✅ HTTPS in production (recommended)

### Password Reset:
If you need to reset a password:

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to Authentication → Users
   - Find the user
   - Click "Send password reset email"

2. **Via Code** (for development):
   ```typescript
   await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail('user@quartermaster.dev')
   ```

## 📝 **Troubleshooting**

### Still Getting Login Loop?
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Supabase URL and keys in `.env.local`

### "Invalid login credentials" Error?
- Try password: `password`
- Try password: `password123`
- Try password: `admin123`
- Check caps lock is off

### Profile Not Loading?
- Check browser console
- Verify user exists in `public.users` table
- Verify email matches between `auth.users` and `public.users`
