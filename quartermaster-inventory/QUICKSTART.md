# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Completed

Your Quarter Master Inventory Management System is fully set up and ready to run!

### Completed Setup:
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ TypeScript configuration fixed
- ✅ Database types aligned with existing Supabase schema
- ✅ Authentication system configured
- ✅ All pages and components created
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented

## 🎯 Start the Application

Simply run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start at: **http://localhost:5173**

## 🔑 Database Connection

The app is configured to connect to your existing Supabase project:
- **Project ID**: ehjudngdvilwvrukcxle
- **Database**: Already populated with users and data
- **Tables**: users, stock_receipts, items_master, receipt_items, documents, audit_logs, approval_workflow

## 👤 User Authentication

The application uses your existing `users` table with the `role` field for access control:

### Role Hierarchy:
1. **semi_user** - Create and edit draft receipts
2. **user** - Verify submitted receipts
3. **admin** - Approve verified receipts, view reports
4. **super_admin** - Full system access

## 📱 Application Features

### Available Pages:
- **Login** (`/auth/login`) - Secure authentication
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Role-specific overview
- **Stock Receipts** (`/receipts`) - Manage all receipts
- **Approvals** (`/approvals`) - Workflow management
- **Inventory Reports** (`/inventory`) - Analytics and exports
- **Documents** (`/documents`) - File management
- **Audit Logs** (`/audit`) - Activity tracking (Admin+)
- **User Management** (`/users`) - User admin (Super Admin only)
- **Profile** (`/profile`) - User settings
- **Settings** (`/settings`) - Application settings

## 🎨 Design System

The UI follows your specified design:
- **Primary Color**: Navy Blue (#1E3A8A)
- **Accent Color**: Green (#22C55E)
- **Background**: Clean White-Gray (#F8FAFC)
- **Typography**: Inter font, professional and readable
- **Icons**: Lucide React (line-style icons)

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT-based authentication via Supabase
- Role-based access control (4 tiers)
- Row-level security on database
- Complete audit trail
- Secure file uploads

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run preview          # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint             # Check for errors
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix errors
npm run type-check       # TypeScript validation
npm run format           # Format code

# Database
npm run db:generate-types # Update types from Supabase
```

## 📝 Important Notes

### CSS Warnings
The IDE may show warnings about `@tailwind` and `@apply` directives. These are expected - Tailwind CSS processes these directives at build time. They won't affect functionality.

### Database Schema
The application works with your existing database structure:
- Uses the `role` field directly from the `users` table
- No need for separate `roles` or `user_roles` tables
- Permission mapping is handled in the AuthProvider

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. **Start the dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Login with an existing user** from your database
3. **Test the role-based features**
4. **Customize as needed** for your specific workflow

## 📚 Documentation

Complete documentation is available in the `/docs` folder:
- **README.md** - Project overview
- **design-system.md** - UI/UX guidelines
- **database-schema.md** - Database structure
- **security.md** - Security implementation
- **setup-guide.md** - Detailed setup instructions
- **deployment-guide.md** - Production deployment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If the server won't start:
```bash
# Clear and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### If you see TypeScript errors:
```bash
# Check types
npm run type-check
```

### If database connection fails:
- Verify `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials
- Check Supabase project status
- Ensure your IP is allowed in Supabase settings

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your Quarter Master application is production-ready with:
- ✅ Modern React 18 + TypeScript setup
- ✅ Secure authentication and authorization
- ✅ Complete inventory management workflow
- ✅ Professional UI with Tailwind CSS
